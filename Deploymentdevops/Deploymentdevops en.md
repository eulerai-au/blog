# Cloud-Native Intelligent Agent System Deployment Research Report: Comprehensive Comparative Analysis of AWS, GCP, Azure, and Alibaba Cloud

This report provides a comprehensive and in-depth comparative analysis of the four major mainstream cloud platforms: AWS, GCP, Azure, and Alibaba Cloud, covering multiple dimensions including scalability, performance expectations, middleware compatibility, observability, deployment integration convenience, CI/CD support, multi-tenant environment isolation, storage service support, and open-source ecosystem activity. Through detailed feature comparisons, cost analysis, and practical deployment recommendations, it provides clear cloud platform selection references for intelligent Agentic Workflow systems based on LangGraph architecture.

 - Optimal:
   - Azure and Alibaba Cloud are the best choices for deploying intelligent Agentic Workflow systems based on LangGraph architecture, as they support pgvector and AGE extensions on PostgreSQL, which are crucial for the system. AWS and GCP do not directly support AGE and may require self-managed PostgreSQL, increasing complexity.

 - Best Choice:  
   - For users in China or Asia, Alibaba Cloud is recommended due to its low latency and local support advantages.  
   - For global users, Azure is recommended for its extensive global coverage and mature services.

 - Cost and Scalability:
   - Azure and Alibaba Cloud are highly competitive in cost and can be adjusted based on resource configuration; strong scalability meets high availability and low latency requirements. Alibaba Cloud provides free trial instances, suitable for small or experimental deployments.

 - MVP Quick Validation Solution:  
   - For cost control and deployment complexity in the startup phase, an MVP solution using a hybrid deployment of Serverless and managed services is recommended. It's suggested to use Alibaba Cloud Function Compute (FC) for low-latency tasks, paired with PolarDB for PostgreSQL as the database, and Serverless Web Hosting or CDN for the frontend to quickly validate core functions and complete the first business loop.

 - Serverless and Managed Services Refinement:  
   - Serverless services like AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, and Alibaba Cloud FC are suitable for low-maintenance requirements with low cost but may have cold start delays. Managed services like PolarDB or Azure Database provide high performance and scalability, directly supporting required extensions, suitable for long-term operations.

 - Deployment Recommendations:
   - Use Kubernetes clusters for production environment deployment, Docker Compose for development environments. Ensure multi-tenancy and environment isolation through VPC and namespaces.
